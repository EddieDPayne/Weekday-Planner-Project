# Work-Day-Schedule

A live schedule of your daily appointments or tasks.

## Description

This application is a Weekday Schedule Planner. In real-time it lets the user enter and save important appointments, daily To-Do's and deadlines. It keeps track of all past, present and future inputs and displays them in a very user friendly way. Utilising localStorage methods so that even after the user ends the session in the browser the entries appear when you next load the application.

Whilst building this application I learned just how versitle and powerful both 'JQuery' and 'Bootstrap' Libraries can be, the importance of correct localStorage use as well as the usefulness of dayjs() methods. It has been an enjoyable experience to be apart of this project and I myself plan to use it daily in the future.

## Installation 

To use this application you need to open the following link in your browser -

 ## Usage 

 With the click of the 'save button' you can add any appointment, deadline or To-do items to this weekday schedule. See clearly wether your entry is either past, is happening now or yet to come with the user friendly color-theme. Grey for past, Red for present and Green for future entries.
